## Keypoints and Resources

### Introduction

- Patrick Winston Quote: "Your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas, in that order."

- [How to Speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=1s) - MIT OpenCourseWare YouTube / Patrick Winston

- Large language models can help you speak, write, and ideate better. These are all skills needed for better storytelling (communicating your ideas.)

### Large Language Models

- **Generative** - creates coherent and sensible output based on statistical probabilities of what comes next in a sequence of words. While plausible, and usually right, it is not always right.

- **Pre-trained** - with vast amounts of content from various sources like books, articles, websites, and code repositories.

- **Transformer** - a machine learning model that understands words, parts of words, and patterns of words and how they relate to each other in context.

### Powerful Prompts

- Prompting Tips
   1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your prompt, the more specific the output will be.
   2. **Be Clear**: Make sure your prompt is clear and concise.
   3. **Be Creative**: Use your imagination to come up with unique and interesting prompts.
   4. **Be Patient**: Sometimes it takes a few tries to get the desired output.

### Guidelines and Limitations

**Azure OpenAI**
- Your data is your data
- Your data from any fine-tuning is not used to train the foundation AI models
- Your data is protected by the most comprehensive enterprise compliance and security controls

**Model Variations**
1. Different models may produce different results for the same prompt.
2. Some models may be better suited for certain types of prompts.
3. Experiment with different models to see which one works best for your needs.

**Hallucinations**
- A situation where the model generates text that is not grounded in reality, is factually incorrect, or doesn't align with the input provided.
- Ground your responses context-relevant data.
